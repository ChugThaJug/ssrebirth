                "Once upon a time, a Zen student quoted an old Buddhist poem to his teacher, which stated, \"The voices of torrents are from one great tongue; the lines of the hills are the pure body of Buddha.\" The student asked his teacher if this was correct. The teacher responded, \"It is said so, but it's a pity to say it. It would be much better if this occasion were celebrated with no talk at all. If I were to address you in the manner of the ancient teachers of Zen, I would simply strike the microphone with my fan and leave.\"",
                "Zen is a way of life and a state of being that cannot be fully embraced through any concepts. Therefore, any concepts, ideas, or words that I present to you this evening will serve to highlight the limitations of language and thought.",
                "If we must attempt to articulate what Zen is, I want to make it clear from the outset that Zen, in its essence, is not a doctrine. There is nothing you are supposed to believe."

                "In discussing the nature of reality, it is important to note that it is not a philosophy in the conventional sense\u2014a rigid set of ideas or an intellectual framework designed to capture the essence of existence. Rather, reality resembles water; it is fluid, transient, and ever-changing. When we find ourselves submerged in this metaphorical water, having been conditioned to live on dry land, we may struggle to adapt. Our instinct may be to stand on the surface, to grasp at the water as if it were solid. However, this approach can lead to drowning.",
                "In the context of contemporary philosophical confusion, where concepts such as the death of God and the meaninglessness of metaphysical propositions prevail, there seems to be little to hold onto. In such an environment, it may feel as if we are all disintegrating, lost in a chaotic sea of uncertainty.",
                "To navigate these turbulent waters, the key is to learn how to swim. This involves a shift in mindset; instead of fighting against the current, we must relax and let go. By surrendering to the flow of reality and embracing its inherent instability, we can find a way to survive and thrive amidst the complexities of modern existence.",
                "In understanding the relationship between water and breathing, one discovers that by knowing how to breathe correctly, one can find support and buoyancy in the water. This analogy can be applied to the concept of Zen. If one attempts to distill Zen into a specific concept, it ultimately revolves around the idea that there exists a singular, great energy in the universe\u2014an energy that remains nameless.",
                "Throughout history, people have attempted to label this energy with various names, such as God, Brahman, or Dao. However, in the Western context, the term \"God\" is often laden with numerous associations that can be off-putting. Many individuals feel discomfort when they hear phrases like \"God the Father Almighty,\" leading to a sense of boredom or confusion. As a result, there is a preference for exploring alternative terms, such as \"Dao\" or \"Brahman,\" as well as other intriguing names from Eastern philosophies. These terms do not carry the same historical baggage or associations of moral sanctimony that often accompany the term \"God.\"",
                "Interestingly, some of the words used by Buddhists to describe the fundamental energy of the world may not have specific meanings at all. This lack of attachment to preconceived notions allows for a more open exploration of the concept, free from the limitations imposed by traditional labels."

                "The term \"Tata,\" which is translated from Sanskrit into concepts like \"suchness\" or \"thusness,\" embodies a deeper meaning rooted in the Sanskrit word \"tat,\" which translates to \"that.\" In Sanskrit, there is an expression that translates to \"thou art,\" which in modern American vernacular can be interpreted as \"you're it.\" Interestingly, the phonetic sound \"d\" is often the first sound a baby makes upon entering the world. Babies look around and utter sounds like \"dada,\" leading parents to believe their child is saying \"Daddy.\" However, from a Buddhist philosophical perspective, all of existence can be viewed as one \"tatata,\" which suggests an interconnectedness among all things.",
                "This concept of \"tatata\" signifies the idea of 10,000 functions or 10,000 things as one suchness. It illustrates that we are all part of this singular suchness, which, like everything else, is transient. The nature of this universe is cyclical, as reflected in the Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. This duality expresses the idea of constant change, where things are here one moment and gone the next. The essence of energy mirrors this dynamic, resembling waves with their crests and troughs. However, we often remain in a state of sleepiness or unawareness, which can obscure our understanding of this fundamental nature of reality.",
                "The concept of illusion suggests that the trough may eventually overcome the wave, or that darkness might triumph over light. This notion evokes a fear that the negative, or dark principle, represented by Yin, could prevail over the positive, or light principle, represented by Yang. We often indulge in this illusion, contemplating the dire consequences that would follow if darkness were to win. This thought can be quite unsettling.",
                "It is indeed peculiar that anything exists at all. The very act of existence requires effort and energy, which raises the question of why there is something rather than nothing. The complexity of being is a significant undertaking, leading some to believe that ultimately, one may give in to the idea of nothingness. However, it is important to recognize that death is merely the other side of energy. It represents a state of rest, a contrast to existence. Just as solid cannot exist without space, space cannot exist without solid.",
                "As we awaken to these realizations, we begin to understand that existence and non-existence are intertwined. The more we change, the more we realize the delicate balance between being and not being."

                "The French suggest that we are all manifestations of a singular energy, and that ultimately, this energy is what defines us. However, to remain perpetually as we are would likely lead to a sense of insufferable boredom. Therefore, it is arranged that we periodically cease being ourselves and return as entirely different individuals. When we come to understand this cycle, we can experience a profound sense of energy and delight. As William Blake articulated, \"Energy is eternal delight.\"",
                "This realization allows us to see through the superficialities of life and recognize our true essence. We are, in essence, indescribable; there are no labels that can encapsulate our being. This understanding alleviates the fundamental fear we often carry. It\u2019s important to note, however, that this doesn\u2019t imply we will always behave heroically or react perfectly in every situation. We may still flinch at sudden noises, experience worries, or lose our tempers.",
                "Ultimately, this perspective enables us to embrace our humanity on a deeper level. Metaphorically speaking, as Janga suggests, the perfect individual utilizes their mind as a tool to navigate the complexities of existence."
