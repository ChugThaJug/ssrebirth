                "When you voluntarily relinquish control and cease to cling to your desires, you gain access to a profound sense of power. It's interesting to note that when you are unsure of what you want, you have reached a state of desirelessness. However, there are different stages of not knowing what you want.",
                "In the beginning stage, you may not know what you want because you haven't given it much thought, or you've only considered it superficially. As you are prompted to reflect more deeply on your desires, you enter a middle stage where you start to identify potential preferences. You might think, \u201cI like this\u201d or \u201cI might enjoy that.\u201d",
                "Eventually, you progress to a more advanced stage of contemplation. Here, you begin to question whether those initial thoughts truly represent what you want. At this point, you may realize that although you could find satisfaction in those options for a time, they do not genuinely fulfill your deeper desires.",
                "There are two primary reasons why you may struggle to know what you truly want. The first reason is that you may already possess what you seek, but fail to recognize it."

                "The concept of understanding oneself and the divine is complex and profound. It is often said that one cannot truly know oneself, just as the divine essence, or godhead, cannot objectify itself. For instance, a knife cannot cut itself, fire does not burn itself, and light does not illuminate itself. This creates an endless mystery regarding self-awareness and the nature of the divine.",
                "In recognizing this mystery, we come to the realization that admitting \"I don't know\" is significant. This acknowledgment resonates within the infinite depths of the spirit. The phrase \"I don't know\" is akin to expressing love; it signifies a willingness to let go rather than trying to control or impose one's will. This mindset embodies humility.",
                "The Upanishads convey a similar message: if you believe you understand Brahman, you do not truly understand. However, if you are aware that you do not understand, then you have made a significant step toward true understanding. Brahman remains unknown to those who think they know it, while it is known to those who admit their ignorance.",
                "The principle here is that whenever you voluntarily relinquish control and cease clinging to your ego, you tap into a wellspring of power. Much of our energy is wasted in self-defense and attempts to manage our circumstances, which ultimately hinders our growth and understanding. Letting go opens the door to greater clarity and connection with the divine essence.",
                "The moment you cease to waste energy on controlling others, that energy becomes available to you. In this sense, you align yourself with the Divine principle. When you are trying to act as if you were God\u2014meaning you don't trust anyone and take on a dictatorial role to keep everyone in line\u2014you lose access to this Divine energy. This behavior turns into self-defense rather than a true expression of energy.",
                "The principle here is that the more you give away, the more energy returns to you. You might think, \u201cI don\u2019t have the courage to give it away; I\u2019m afraid.\u201d However, you can only overcome this fear by recognizing that holding on to energy is futile. Everything around you is in a constant state of dissolution; we are all in a process of decay and transformation. This realization can be a source of great assistance. Acknowledging that everything is in decay allows you to understand that letting go is essential for embracing the flow of energy and life."

                "The concept of letting go is crucial in understanding the nature of power and energy. You don\u2019t actually have to let go because there\u2019s nothing to hold on to; everything is achieved for you through the process of nature. Once you recognize this, you may feel a sense of despair, realizing that you have no control over your existence and that you will ultimately vanish, leaving behind nothing. However, when you truly embrace this understanding, you suddenly discover an enormous access to energy.",
                "This energy is not the result of grasping or trying to seize power; rather, it comes to you in a completely opposite way. Power that arrives in this manner is power you can trust. There is a game played in Zen that helps illustrate this point. When you approach a teacher for spiritual instruction or attend a seminar, you may be confusing yourself. By seeking what you want externally, you are implying that someone else can provide it to you, which suggests you do not possess it yourself. The teacher understands that as long as you maintain this mindset, you have not yet grasped the true essence of your inquiry.",
                "In certain situations, individuals may encounter teachers or leaders who do not directly dismiss them with a simple \"go away.\" Instead, these figures might express that they are too busy to engage. However, many people often refuse to accept such rejection. They might seek out other teachers who could exploit them for their own gain, potentially keeping them as followers for extended periods and profiting significantly from them.",
                "To maintain their grip, some leaders employ tactics that undermine their followers' confidence. They might convey the message that their followers have a long way to go in their journey and that their current achievements are far from perfect. Often, these leaders will criticize other sects or schools, suggesting that they lack true understanding. This approach can lead followers to doubt themselves, thinking, \"I haven't yet attained this,\" which paradoxically keeps them motivated to work harder.",
                "However, this dynamic can be likened to a pickpocket who steals a person's watch and then sells it back to them. The followers are led to believe that they need the guidance of such a leader, even as they are being manipulated and exploited in the process."

                "When you find yourself momentarily slipping into a mystical experience, you become acutely aware of the tremendous gamesmanship at play in the universe. This awareness reveals a continuous cycle of existence, where creatures consume one another. The beings that are consumed transform into the very creatures that eat them, perpetuating a cycle of life and death. It becomes evident that this intricate game is part of a larger cosmic scheme.",
                "Moreover, you come to realize that the state of development you are currently in is neither superior nor inferior to anyone else's. Just as in the vastness of space, where no planet or star holds a definitive position of superiority, all states of existence are equal. Each point on the surface of a sphere can be considered the center, illustrating that every perspective holds its own significance. This understanding fosters a sense of unity and equality among all forms of life, emphasizing that we are all interconnected in this grand cosmic experience.",
                "In examining human behavior, it becomes evident that individuals can be viewed from various perspectives, such as sick or healthy, good or bad, neurotic or normal, psychotic or sane. All these manifestations can be likened to leaves on a tree, each person's unique expression of existence. From a spiritual standpoint, Christians might say that this is a manifestation of the will of God.",
                "From this perspective, there is nothing that one needs to do to attain a state of being; it is already inherent. However, this concept can be challenging to grasp. Many people, upon hearing that there is nothing to do, mistakenly attempt to do nothing. This is impossible because we are defined by our actions\u2014Karma, which literally means action.",
                "The pursuit of understanding oneself can often feel elusive. It is similar to trying to bite your own teeth or look into your own eyes; it is inherently difficult to achieve true self-awareness. The key lies in recognizing that the very act of seeking is part of what it means to be. Thus, understanding oneself requires embracing the complexity of our actions and the unique ways we express our existence."
