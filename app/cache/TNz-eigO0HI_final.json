We will designate \"front end\" as the folder where we will store all components of our front-end application.",
                "As the application is being created, we will select the options we want to include in our project. For this setup, I will choose the BeBorn Skeleton app, the Skeleton framework, Tailwind, forms, typography, code blocks, popups, TypeScript syntax, linting with Prettier, F test, and Svelte Inspector. Once we've made our selections, we will allow the installation to complete.",
                "After the installation, we will navigate into the front-end directory and install all necessary packages by running `npm install`. With everything installed, we will need to add a few additional scripts to the project."

                "Another crucial step for the frontend application is to include the domain name of the backend API. This can be accomplished by obtaining the domain name from the application hosted on Digital Ocean and pasting it into the fetch request.",
                "Finally, we will need to make some amendments to the backend Python file, `main.py`. We should include the FastAPI CORS middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This will involve specifying the origins for both localhost and the port we are using."

                "Next, we will create the frontend application. This involves creating a resource from the source by selecting GitHub and choosing the Dice API repository. We will designate the directory for this as \"frontend.\"",

Once everything is in order, we can proceed to create the resource and update the HTTP requests accordingly."

This ensures that both the front end and back end of the application are aligned in terms of functionality.",
                "Now, the application is live, and we can observe on the screen that the inspector console displays the value returned from the API. This indicates that the Python application is functioning correctly in the back end, as we are encountering no CORS errors. Furthermore, the front end is updating seamlessly to reflect the returned value.",
                "This example illustrates a straightforward approach to creating a front end for a Python API. We now have the flexibility to modify the Python application to perform any necessary tasks in the background, while also enhancing the front end to ensure a smooth user experience. In my opinion, this method is significantly easier than developing a graphical user interface for a desktop application. Additionally, the ability to quickly host the application on a digital platform simplifies the entire process even further."
